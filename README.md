  # Demo succes?

In order to learn how to upload Programs to Github, I used this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk
During the video some commands where different between Mac/Linux & Windows, so here you can find the equivalent commands for 
terminal in Windows. 
Also, if you want to use the commands like in the video, then its better if you use `Gitbash` which should be already installed in you desktop, just type the windows icon and search it.


## Commands I've used in Terminal

#### git ls-files 
to show the documents inside the File

#### cls 
to clear / clean the Terminal

#### git add [name of document]
to add modifications on that file or...

#### git add . 
to add all modification in every document.

#### git status
to check the status of the files if are modified or not.
